# Site-v2 / Playground

## Objective

I will host in this repository the code for my personal site and it will also work as a playground for other technologies that I want to try in my personal site so that I can implement them and see how they work before using them in a real life scenario.

You'll se in the commit history, a lot of code deleted, new code added, code moved from one directory to another, and it is completely normal because of the motivation of this repository.

## What I am building

As mentioned before, I am building a personal site, I wasn't sure of what I should include and what I should not, but here I have a starter list of requirementes that I asked ChatGPT to generate for me:

>A personal website for a developer can include the following pages and sections:
>1. About: Brief introduction to who you are, your skills and expertise, and your professional experience. You can also include a headshot or professional photo of yourself.
>1. Resume: You can use this page to showcase your resume or CV, highlighting your education, employment history, and any relevant achievements or certifications.
>1. Portfolio: This page can include examples of your work, such as projects you have completed or open source contributions. You can include links to live demos or code repositories.
>1. Contact: This page should include your contact information, such as your email address and social media links. You can also include a form for visitors to send you messages or inquiries.
>1. Blog (future iteration): As you mentioned, you can add a blog section to your website in a future iteration. This can be a place for you to share your thoughts and insights on topics related to your field, as well as any updates or news about your work.

Adding an :black_square_button: About, :black_square_button: Resume, :black_square_button: Portfolio and :black_square_button: Contact section, seems like a good objective to start working on. The plan would be to add a blog at some point if I really find this project interesting and funny for my own free time.

## How to run the project

I will be adding instructions on how to run the project and any relevant information as I work on it.
