# My Personal Site & Playground

## Objective

This repository contains the code for my personal website, which serves as a
portfolio and a place to share my thoughts and insights on topics related to my
field. It is also a playground for experimenting with new technologies and
techniques. You can expect to see a lot of changes and updates to the code as I
continue to work on and improve the site.

## Features

In the first iteration that I am currently working on, the website will include
the following pages and sections:

- [ ] About
- [ ] Resume
- [ ] Portfolio
- [ ] Contact

I plan to add a blog section in a future iteration, where I can share my
thoughts and insights on topics related to my field, as well as any updates or
news about my work.

### Technologies I'm Testing

I am using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for this project. I may also
experiment with other technologies and techniques as I continue to work on the
site.

### Technologies I'm Interested In (but not using in this project)

I have found the following technologies interesting but have decided not to
incorporate them into this project:

- [astro.build](https://astro.build/)
- [Create-t3](https://create.t3.gg/)

## How to Run the Project

Instructions for running the project will be added as I continue to work on it.
