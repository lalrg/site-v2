# Styling technique: Choosing CSS Modules

I will mainly use tailwind, but when necessary I will use CSS Modules.

## Advantages of Using CSS Modules
- Easy implementation and maintenance
- Scoped styles that don't affect other components
- Dynamic class names that prevent naming collisions
- Ability to import styles from other modules

## Fit with Project Needs
The portfolio site is a small project with a limited number of pages and
components. CSS Modules provide a simple solution for styling that is easy to
implement and maintain, without sacrificing the benefits of modularity and
scalability. With scoped styles and dynamic class names, CSS Modules ensure that
the styles for one component don't interfere with another. This allows for clean
and efficient code, making CSS Modules a great fit for the portfolio site
project.

For now, I will start by setting the initial style that I need to achive certain
view, later on I will implement theming and other requirements that I may have.
